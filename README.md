# play-scales

This is a weekend project for me to have an handy and clean page to visualize music scales.  
[The project is published here](https://www.play-scales.com).

## Instructions

Using `npm`:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Credits

Thanks for all the open source libraries used in this project. All of this made my day.
